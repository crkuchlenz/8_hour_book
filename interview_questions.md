# Introduction
1. Can you share a bit about your background and what inspired you to focus on personal growth and mindset development?

As a data engineer for a decade and a half, I have been exposed to many different teams and methodologies. One of my biggest struggles was adapting whenever there was a shift.
In order to combat this, I found that being honest and open about what I was comfortable doing was the best approach.
If people are not aware of your own lack of competency in a certain area, they will not know to avoid assigning you those issues.

2. How did you become passionate about helping others develop accountability and clarity in their lives?

My initial curiosity came from John Maxwell's 360 degree leadership. 
I started to understand that my influence to instruct my managerial team on what I lacked, was pivotal.

3. Who do you believe would benefit most from the solutions you’re sharing today? What type of individuals are often drawn to your work?

I believe that there are a number of people in technology who are struggling to keep up with the innovations happening around us, from a junior dev all the way up to the CIO.
Growth is intentional, and if you are not intentionally growing to create clarity, it is going to be a stressful journey.

4. Can you describe a pivotal moment in your journey that led you to understand the importance of personal growth?

Having to sit down with my project team and explain that, even though we have been working on issues, I still did not have a clear vision on the end result.
